        Material Analysis
                   Type 38 Japanese Infantry Rifle 
        The material object in discussion is a Type 38 Arisaka, 6.5mm bolt-action rifle often found on infantrymen of the Japanese Imperial Army in the early to mid-20th century. The rifle was inducted by the army in 1905 and designed by esteemed Colonel Arisaka Nariakira, whose craftsmanship would lead to an entire family of service rifles carrying the title of “Arisaka”. The type 38 rifle model weighs a portable 8.7lbs and consists of a long barrel with fittings available for a bayonet preceded by an ergonomic wooden stock. It is similar in design principle to Mauser and Mannlicher rifles of the contemporary period but adopted a few innovations to accommodate the smaller stature of Japanese soldiers. The standard magazine capacity of this rifle houses 5 rounds of 6.5x50mm caliber bullets which carries less recoil and allows a rate of fire estimated somewhere between thirty rounds per minute in the hands of a trained marksman. The rear of the rifle houses the majority of its firing mechanisms with the rifle’s receiver and bolt handle being easily accessible. Notably, the receiver carries a stamp of a 16 leafed chrysanthemum flower, signifying the rifle’s belonging to the Emperor of Japan and serving as a symbol of allegiance. Given the historical background of Japan’s Samurai warrior class, holding this rifle may have been a cultural reminder of a deeply engrained warrior’s spirit. The front of the rifle tapers then off from the sighted receiver and magazine chamber onwards, mounting a matching iron sight on the end of its 31.50 inch barrel. Having seen a service period of over forty years with use in Japanese, Chinese and even Great Britain’s Army, the Arisaka Type 38 can be safely labeled as reliable with over 3,400,000 manufactured across state arsenals. 
          This specific rifle however leaves a potential mystery to speculate in regards to its history and moments before its acquisition. The rifle was taken off of a Japanese soldier by United States Marine Corps Sergeant, Robert Copeland in April of 1945 during the first wave of invasion on the northern end of Okinawa Island. (Notably, Sergeant Copeland and his “E” company of the 22nd Marines regiment, 6th Marine Division consisted of the vanguard on these islands and were noted as the first to capture several Japanese naval personnel.) Towards the front of the wooden stock on its right hand side just below the ejection point are four distinct slash marks. These marks may imply a struggle between its previous owner and his enemy, painting an image of a raised rifle to deflect the downwards slashes of a bladed weapon, whether it be a bayonet or a machete. Above one of these marks lies a chip in the wood that upon reenactment suggests that for a moment, the bladed edge of whatever struck the stock became lodged and was subsequently twisted slightly to free itself, leaving behind an angled indentation. Given that the donor of this rifle was a US Marine, and Marines active in the Pacific Theatre were noted to carry machetes, a perilous encounter between Japanese soldier and US Marine may be more of a possibility rather than a romanticization.
